#Build a method sort_array_asc that takes in an array of integers and
#returns a copy of the array with the integers in ascending order.

def sort_array_asc(array)
  array.sort do |a, b|
    a <=> b
  end
end

#Build a method sort_array_desc that takes in an array of integers and
#returns a copy of the array with the integers in descending order.
#Remember that .sort takes a block in which you can specify how you want your array sorted.

def sort_array_desc(array)
  array.sort! do |a, b|
    b <=> a
  end
end

#Build a method sort_array_char_count that takes in an array of strings
#and returns a copy of the array with the strings ordered in ascending
#order by length. Remember that .sort takes a block in which you can specify how you want your array sorted.

def sort_array_char_count(array)
  array.sort do |a, b|
    a.length <=> b.length
  end
end

#Build a method swap_elements that takes in an array and swaps the second
#and third elements. Remember that array indices start at 0, so the second
#element has an index of 1 and the third element has an index of 2.

def swap_elements(array)
  array[1], array[2] = array[2], array[1]
  array
end

#Build a method reverse_array that takes in an array of integers and returns
#a copy of the array with the elements in reverse order.

def reverse_array(array)
  array.reverse! do |x, y|
    y <=> x
  end
end

#Build a method called kesha_maker that takes in an array of strings and
#replaces the third character in each string with a $ ("dollar sign")â€”Ke$ha style.
#Use the .each method to iterate and build a new array to return at the end of
#your method, just like we did in the "My Each" lab.

def kesha_maker(array)
  array.each do |characters|
    characters[2] = "$"
  end
end

#Build a method find_a that returns all the strings in the array passed to it that
#start_with? (hint) the letter "a". You'll want to use a high level iterator for
#this that finds, selects, or detects elements based on a condition.

def find_a(character)
  character.select {|letter| letter.start_with? ("a")}
end

#Build a method sum_array that adds together all of the integers in the array and returns their sum.
#Advanced: Try using the .inject method here.

def sum_array(sum)
  sum.inject(0) do |sum, value|
    sum += value
  end
end

#Build a method that adds an "s" to each word in the array except for the second element in
#the array ("feet" is already plural).
#Advanced: Iterators in Ruby are chainable, see if you can use .each_with_index in addition to
#.collect to solve this one in an elegant way. What happens if you write:
#[1,2].each_with_index.collect{|element, index| }

def add_s(array)
  array.collect do |word|
    if array[1] == word
      word
    else
